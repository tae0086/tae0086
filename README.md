# Hi there, I'm TAEGYUN LEE ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a dedicated researcher and developer with a strong focus on **Explainable AI (XAI)** and its application in **developmental assessment**. My current work involves using **deep learning** models to analyze child-drawn sketches, providing automated developmental evaluations with a high degree of transparency and explainability. My research interests include **rule-based** and **object-based** methods for automating scoring processes and explaining predictions using models like **Vision Transformer (ViT)**.

I believe that making AI more explainable helps build trust in automated systems, especially in critical areas like childhood development and educational assessments. When I'm not researching, I enjoy exploring the latest trends in **machine learning**, **data science**, and **AI ethics**.

## Contributions

Here are some contributions I'm especially proud of:

- **Explainable AI for Developmental Assessments**:  
  In this project, I developed a two-fold approach using **rule-based methods** for automated scoring and **object-based methods** for analyzing child-drawn sketches. This work has contributed to making developmental evaluations more reliable and transparent, offering parents and educators clear insights into a childâ€™s progress.

- **Vision Transformer (ViT) for Child-Drawing Analysis**:  
  I applied **Vision Transformer** models to dissect child-drawn images into key features such as eyes, mouth, and facial structure, allowing us to track **relevance maps** that show why the model made specific predictions about developmental states. This work supports early detection and provides a **clear path** for understanding AI-driven decisions.

- **Rule-based Scoring Automation**:  
  By leveraging **Contrastive Learning**, I improved performance in rule-based models even with limited data, helping to generate understandable, text-based explanations of scoring for professionals evaluating child development.
